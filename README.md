## USB Automation Script (Adafruit CircuitPython HID)

### This project demonstrates how to use an Adafruit board running CircuitPython as a Human Interface Device (HID) to automate keyboard input.
### Think of it like a programmable keyboard macro tool (similar to a Rubber Ducky concept, but legal & DIY).

## ✅ What This Project Does

Sends keystrokes automatically (like a macro keyboard)

Useful for:

automation demos

educational cybersecurity practice

testing input automation

productivity shortcuts

## ❌ What This Project Does NOT Do

It is not designed for unauthorized access

Not intended for malicious activity

Does not bypass login screens or security systems
